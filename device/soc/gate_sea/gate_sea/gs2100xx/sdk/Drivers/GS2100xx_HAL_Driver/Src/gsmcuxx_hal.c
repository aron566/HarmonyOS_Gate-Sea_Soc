  ==============================================================================
    [..]
    The common HAL driver contains a set of generic and common APIs that can be
    used by the PPP peripheral drivers and the user to start using the HAL.
    [..]
    The HAL contains two APIs' categories:
         (+) Common HAL APIs
         (+) Services HAL APIs

    [..]  This section provides functions allowing to:
      (+) Initializes the Flash interface the NVIC allocation and initial clock
          configuration. It initializes the systick also when timeout is needed
          and the backup domain when enabled.
      (+) de-Initializes common part of the HAL
      (+) Configure The time base source to have 1ms time base with a dedicated
          Tick interrupt priority.
        (++) Systick timer is used by default as source of time base, but user
             can eventually implement his proper time base source (a general purpose
             timer for example or other time source), keeping in mind that Time base
             duration should be kept 1ms since PPP_TIMEOUT_VALUEs are defined and
             handled in milliseconds basis.
        (++) Time base configuration function (HAL_InitTick ()) is called automatically
             at the beginning of the program after reset by HAL_Init() or at any time
             when clock is configured, by HAL_RCC_ClockConfig().
        (++) Source of time base is configured  to generate interrupts at regular
             time intervals. Care must be taken if HAL_Delay() is called from a
             peripheral ISR process, the Tick interrupt line must have higher priority
            (numerically lower) than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller
            ISR process will be blocked.
       (++) functions affecting time base configurations are declared as __weak
             to make  override possible  in case of other  implementations in user file.

 * @brief  This function is used to initialize the HAL Library; it must be the first

 *         HAL function), it performs the following:
 *           Configure the Flash prefetch, instruction and Data caches.
 *           Configures the SysTick to generate an interrupt each 1 millisecond,
 *           which is clocked by the HSI (at this stage, the clock is not yet
 *           configured and thus the system is running from the internal HSI at 16 MHz).
 *           Set NVIC Group Priority to 4.
 *           Calls the HAL_MspInit() callback function defined in user file
 *           "stm32f4xx_hal_msp.c" to do the global low level hardware initialization
 *
 * @note   SysTick is used as time base for the HAL_Delay() function, the application
 *         need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
 *         to have correct HAL operation.
